import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { businessDescription } = await req.json()

const prompt = `Generate 5 short, unique, SEO-optimized, and X algorithm-friendly marketing posts for this business:

"${businessDescription}"

Each post should:
- Be on its own line with no bold text, bullet numbers, titles, or summaries.
- Use 1â€“3 relevant, trending hashtags naturally (avoid generic or spammy ones).
- Include emojis to enhance engagement but keep it professional and relevant.
- Feel authentic, conversational, and non-promotional to avoid algorithm penalties.
- Encourage engagement (e.g., ask a question, spark curiosity, or invite replies) to boost likes, replies, or reposts within the first hour.
- Be 100â€“200 characters for readability and impact.
- Incorporate high-quality visual suggestions (e.g., image, GIF, or video) described in brackets at the end of each post.
- Avoid excessive links (use only 1 link sparingly, e.g., to bio or profile, if needed).
- Use natural keywords related to the business for SEO without keyword stuffing.
- Drive subtle conversions (e.g., profile visits, replies, or user actions) without hard selling.
